					HTML is the dominant markup language for web pages in the sense of the
					hypertext markup language (Hypertext Markup Language, or the hypertext markup language).
					HTML provides a way to create structured documents with links, citations,
					and other items, as well as representing structural meaning for text such as titles, paragraphs, lists,
					and so on. And can be used to embed images and objects and generate interactive forms.
				</P>
				<p>
					HTML is written in the form of HTML elements with "tags" enclosed in angle brackets within the web page content.
					HTML can include or invoke JavaScript, which affects the behavior of HTML processing devices such as web browsers,
					and CSS, which defines the appearance and placement of text and other items. W3C, co-head of the HTML
					and CSS standards, recommends the use of CSS for clear and representative markup.
